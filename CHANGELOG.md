### Development Environment
- Node.js version: 18.20.5
- Python version: 3.11
- Key dependencies:
  - Frontend:
    - next: ^14.2.18
    - react: 18.2.0
    - tailwindcss: ^3.3.6
    - framer-motion: ^10.16.16
  - Backend:
    - fastapi: 0.104.1
    - uvicorn: 0.24.0
    - scikit-learn: 1.3.2
    - pandas: 2.1.3
    - sqlalchemy: 2.0.23

### Configuration
- Environment variables structure:
  ```
  # Backend (.env)
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/coursedb
  REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
  JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
  
  # Frontend (.env.local)
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
  ```

### API Endpoints
- `/api/v1/courses/`: Course management
- `/api/v1/recommendations/`: AI recommendations
- `/api/v1/users/`: User management
- `/api/v1/auth/`: Authentication

### Known Issues and Solutions
- Port conflicts: Use different ports for services (3000 for frontend, 8000 for backend)
- Permission issues: Set appropriate directory permissions (chmod 755)
- Node.js cache: Clear npm cache and reinstall if needed
